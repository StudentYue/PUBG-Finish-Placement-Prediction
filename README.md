# PUBG-Finish-Placement-Prediction
This project is a group project of a machine learning course. The project focuses on the PUBG game, which predicts the player's final ranking based on millions of player game statistics. After the abnormal point recognition and deleting operation, we construct the effective feature engineering and use the ensemble learning and deep learning methods to predict the final placement of players. The final absolute error is about 0.04 (based on rank percentage).
